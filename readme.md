 changed my mind, decided this is too much for me, i hate classes and i hate working with oop i think its overrated and completely unneccessary, (if you are reading this omer the most difficult thing for me in this module was to come up with ideas for projects, just wanted to let you know)

 i decided to make a diet tracker app, users can log their meals and see how much caories they had,

 im gonna have bmi and rmi calculators 

 im gonna track each users diet and display progress
